-- ElvUI (and some others) disable the entire HelpPlate system rather than
-- specifically managing it on the frames they modify or handling the automated
-- tutorials in a more granular way.
--
-- Since XRP makes use of it as the only help system, and very comprehensively,
-- re-enable it. If those addons want to disable it on default frames, it
-- should be done just for those frames.
